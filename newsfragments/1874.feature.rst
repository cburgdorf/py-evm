Make handling of different consensus mechanisms more flexible and sound.

Introduce a new property ``consensus_engine_class`` on the ``Chain``. The chain take care
of instantiating the consensus engine and exposes it as ``consensus_engine``.

Also add ``PowConsensus`` and ``NoProofConsensus`` as engines and refactor ``eth.tools.*`` to
use these.
